  This extension makes FREAKING 3D MODELS POSSIBLE IN MAKECODE ARCADE!!! This is pretty exciting because it's pretty easy to understand. You just have to import your 3d model into this handy converter [found here](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1075036652) and then copy and paste the output into your project.
