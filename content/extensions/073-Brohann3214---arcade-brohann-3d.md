3D models are now easier to implement in MakeCode Arcade! You can now render textured triangles at a "reasonable speed". (for a computer) Thanks to the work of @pecan4, you can easily convert 3D models to JS code for this extension just by following these [instructions](https://forum.makecode.com/t/brohanns-3d-devlog/20917/131?u=unsignedarduino). Look for more demos throughout the linked forum post. This adds a new category in the toolbox called `Brohann3D`.
