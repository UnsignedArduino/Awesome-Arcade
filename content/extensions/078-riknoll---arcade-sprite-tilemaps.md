This extension allows you to set tilemaps for individual sprites, so tile overlap events are fired and those sprites will interact with walls while also allowing you to use the normal overlap and wall hit event blocks for your sprite! Although they do not get drawn to the screen, they can still be useful for separating the actual tilemap from the game logic, etc. Heed the warning that "this engine replaces the physics engine, so it is not compatible with any other extension that overwrites the physics engine." This extension adds a Sprite Tilemaps category.
