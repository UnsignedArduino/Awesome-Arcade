I have written a Python script that will turn your MakeCode Arcade games into cross-platform standalone offline-capable Electron apps! Note that this tool requires at least Python 3.12 and Node.js 21 on a computer, your MakeCode Arcade game deployed to GitHub Pages, and command line knowledge is highly recommended! Check the GitHub README for more information.
